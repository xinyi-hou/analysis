# Comprehensive Analysis of the OpenAI Developer Forum

The OpenAI Developer Forum is a hub for developers to discuss their experiences, seek guidance, and share best practices related to OpenAI's technologies.

## Research Questions

### RQ1: Popularity Trends
- **Objective:** Analyze activity trends on the forum.
- **Focus:** Identify popular topics and user engagement trends.

### RQ2: Taxonomy of Concerns
- **Objective:** Classify specific developer concerns.
- **Focus:** Understand common obstacles and issues in the developer community.

## Methodology
The methodology consists of five primary steps:

### Step 1: Crawl Forum Topic Lists
Collected 29,576 topics from 17 categories using a custom web crawler to gather comprehensive topic lists and verify completeness.

### Step 2: Scrape All Post Details
Extracted complete post information for each topic, including attributes like `post_id`, `username`, `content`, and `engagement metrics`.

### Step 3: Identify Popularity Trends
Conducted time series analysis to investigate the growth and decline of interest in specific topics and examined factors affecting engagement.

### Step 4: Filter Developers' Concern Topics
Filtered 9,301 active topics from 2024 across `API`, `ChatGPT`, `GPT builders`, and `Prompting` categories for detailed analysis.

### Step 5: Construct a Taxonomy of Concerns
Developed a taxonomy of concerns based on forum categories, using a sample of 886 topics and achieving high inter-rater agreement (Cohen's Kappa of 0.835). The taxonomy includes three root categories (`API/ChatGPT`, `GPT Builders`, `Prompting`), 13 inner categories, and 50 leaf categories.
